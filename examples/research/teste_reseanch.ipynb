    "To answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\n",
    "1/ intro\n",

    "3/ overview of topic B\n",
    "4/ comparison between A and B\n",
    "5/ conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\n",
    "1/ list of things or table of things\n",
    "Or, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don't need an introduction or conclusion.\n",
    "1/ item 1\n",
    "2/ item 2\n",
    "3/ item 3\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\n",
    "1/ overview of topic\n",
    "2/ concept 1\n",
    "3/ concept 2\n",
    "4/ concept 3\n",

    "Make sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each section of the report, do the following:\n",
    "- Use simple, clear language\n",
    "- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\n",
    "- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \n",
    "- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\n",
    "- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\n",
